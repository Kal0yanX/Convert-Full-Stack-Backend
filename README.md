# Full-Stack-Backend
Recipe CRUD Application with React.js, Node.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, Vercel, and Postman Services
This is a README.md file for your Recipe CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using a stack that includes React.js for the frontend, Node.js with Express for the backend, MongoDB with Mongoose for the database, Vercel for deployment, and Postman for testing the API.

## Quick Start

Install Dependencies:

First, make sure you have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your system.

```bash
npm i
```

Install the required Node.js packages by running npm install in both the client and server directories.
Set Up MongoDB:

Create a MongoDB database and configure the connection string in the server/config/db.config.js file.
Start the Backend Server:

Navigate to the server directory and run:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Start the Frontend Application:
```bash
npm start
```

Navigate to the client directory and run npm start to start the React.js frontend application.
Access the Application:

Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to use the Recipe CRUD application.

## Postman Services
To test your API endpoints and ensure they work as expected, you can use Postman. Here's how to set it up:

Install Postman:

Download and install Postman.
Import Postman Collection:

Import the provided Postman collection that includes requests for testing your CRUD operations.
Configure Environment Variables (Optional):

Set up environment variables in Postman to store API endpoints and other necessary details.
Execute Requests:
